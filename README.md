AN E-COMMERCE DJANGO PROJECT. 

# This is an e-commerce django project with all the fundamental features of an online store. I named it Oloja

# The templates used in the frontend is designed by https://boostrapious.com. 

# The templates are great for learning how to build an e-commerce website. You should get better UI/UX for a real e-commerce website.

# In case you won't be using the requirements.txt file in this repo, Note that I used Celery to handle sending of order mail as an asynchronous task. So you will need to have Celery installed.

# You will also need to configure a message broker for Celery. You can use key/value stores like redis or a message system like RabbitMQ.

# Adios!
